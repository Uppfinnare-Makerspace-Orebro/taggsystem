# States

 0. Default. Identified user or admin will signal to the relay, holding button at the same time triggers state 1
 1. Button is pressed when no user is identified
 2. Admin state - Add user, button triggers next state, tag adds user
 3. Admin state - Add admin, button triggers next state, tag adds admin
 4. Admin state - Remove admin, button triggers next resets to next state, tag deletes user
 5. Trigger if no user is set, then the first user showing its card will be admin

# Build arduino

Install platformio. Make sure that the command `platformio` or `pio` is available.
if one does not exist try the other.

If you want to install arduino for the commandline on ubuntu use the command

```
pip3 install platformio
```

run

```bash
platformio run -e esp32` to find compilation errors
```

run 

```bash
platformio run -e esp32 -t upload` to build and upload the program to the arduino
```


Build and run esp32
```bash
platformio run -e esp32 --target upload
```


## Todo:
- [ ] Connect and test relay
- [ ] Asynchronous flash that does not delay state logic

## Advanced: Build test project (ubuntu linux pc tests, without a physical device)

Install 

```bash
sudo apt install cmake build-essensial
```

create build directory and build

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../.. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
make -j
``` 

Run tests:

In the build directory

```bash
ctest .
```
