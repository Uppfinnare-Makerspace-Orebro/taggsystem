# taggsystem
SUF taggsystem f√∂r maskiner

# Dependencies
Install the `MFRC522` - library for arduino

# Connections in prototype

LED pin 6 (out)
button signal in 7
button activation pin 8 (should be always on)
relay pin 2


# States

0 - Default. Identified user or admin will signal to the relay, holding button at the same time triggers state 1
1 - Admin state - Add user, button triggers next state, tag adds user
2 - Admin state - Add admin, button triggers next state, tag adds admin
3 - Admin state - Remove admin, button triggers next resets to next state, tag deletes user

4 - Trigger if no user is set, then the first user showing its card will be admin

# Build arduino

Install platformio. Make sure that the command `platformio` or `pio` is available.
if one does not exist try the other.

If you want to install arduino for the commandline on ubuntu use the command

```
pip3 install platformio
```

run

`platformio run -e esp32` to find compilation errors

run 

`platformio run -e esp32 -t upload` to build and upload the program to the arduino


Build and run nodemcu
```bash
platformio run -e nodemcu --target upload
```

## Advanced: Build test project (ubuntu linux pc tests, without a physical device)

Install cmake, build-essensial etc.

create build directory and build

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../.. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
make -j
``` 

Run tests:

In the build directory

```bash
ctest .
```

## Advanced: Build emscripten (web simulator)

Install emscripten

run like the simulator above but replace `cmake` with `emcmake cmake`...
and `make` with `emmake make`


## Wierd build errors

If you get wierd build errors, try to remove the currently downloaded packades
and cache like so

```bash
rm -R -f ~/.platformio/.cache/ ~/.platformio/packages/
```

or for windows, remove the corresponding folders

```
 C:\Users\<user>\.platformio\packages + C:\Users\<user>\.platformio\platforms (+.cache)
```
